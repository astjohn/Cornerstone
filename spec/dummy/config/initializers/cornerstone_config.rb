# Use this hook to configure cornerstone.
Cornerstone::Config.setup do |config|

  # == Authenticated User Method
  # Specify the method in which your application accesses the authenticated user.
  # You may use a Proc to call a helper method in your application.  The helper method
  # must return an authenticated user.
  # Alternatively, you may specify ':warden' if you are using Warden for authentication.
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  # config.auth_with = Proc.new {|helper| helper.current_user}
  # config.auth_with = :warden
  config.auth_with = :warden


  # == Discussion Statuses
  # An array of strings which specify the status options for a discussion.
  # The first status option becomes the default value used in the database.
  # The last status option becomes the default value when a discussion is 'closed.'
  config.discussion_statuses = ["Open", "Resolved"]

  # == Mailer From Address
  # The default 'from' email address for the mailer to use.
  config.mailer_from = "no-reply@cornerstone.com"

  # == Administrators emails
  # An array of strings which specify which users to email when a new discussion is created.
  config.admin_emails = ["admins@cornerstone.com"]

  # == User Input Sanitization
  # Cornerstone relies on the wonderful Sanitize gem to sanitize user input.
  # Specifically, sanitization will occur on the name, email and body attributes of a post.
  # Please refer to: https://github.com/rgrove/sanitize
  config.sanitize_options = Sanitize::Config::BASIC
